𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: 𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝗮𝗻 𝗟𝗟𝗠
If your framework doesn’t iterate for you (like n8n), use a reasoning-optimized model (e.g. o1-mini).

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀
What does your agent need to act? Add:
Calculators
APIs & functions
Integrations
External data
MCP servers

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟒: 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆
Let your agent think over time:
Short-term (last turns, variables)
Long-term (vector, SQL, graph memory)

𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟓: 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰
Even agents need a conductor.
Design reusable flows
Route coordination across agents (static or dynamic)
